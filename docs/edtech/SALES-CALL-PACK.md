# Sales Call Pack (Launch-Ready)

This call pack is constrained to currently shipped pages and APIs.

## 30-second pitch

PolicyPilot helps GRC and security teams prove AI policy adoption, not just policy existence.  
When a policy changes, PolicyPilot generates role-specific learning, tracks acknowledgments and outcomes, and produces control-ready evidence with lineage and checksums.

## 5-minute walkthrough

1. Open `/product/admin/dashboard` and show freshness, controls, and intervention queue.
2. Open `/product/admin/policies` and upload a policy file.
3. Open `/product/admin/campaigns`, generate draft, then open `/product/admin/campaigns/[campaignId]`.
4. Show learning-first flow: module material first, quiz second, and media slots marked as coming soon where applicable.
5. Publish and move to learner experience at `/product/learn/[assignmentId]`:
   - learner reads material
   - learner acknowledges material
   - learner takes quiz
6. Return to `/product/admin/controls` to show control mapping and evidence objects.
7. Open `/product/admin/adoption` and `/product/admin/interventions` to show freshness/risk and remediation workflow.

## Objection handling by region

### EU

- Buyer concern: “We already documented AI policy; why add this?”
- Response: Documentation alone is not adoption proof. PolicyPilot provides role-level adoption records and control freshness views that are audit-friendly.

### US

- Buyer concern: “Regulatory expectations keep shifting.”
- Response: PolicyPilot is a workflow layer that shortens policy-update to evidence time and helps teams react quickly without rebuilding training operations each cycle.

### India

- Buyer concern: “Our teams are distributed and process maturity is uneven.”
- Response: PolicyPilot standardizes policy-to-learning execution and gives central visibility into who has acknowledged, who is overdue, and where controls are stale.

## Demo guardrails

1. Do not claim automated video generation (currently coming soon).
2. Do not claim full replacement of Vanta/Drata.
3. Keep positioning as coexistence: PolicyPilot owns AI policy adoption outcomes and evidence quality.
