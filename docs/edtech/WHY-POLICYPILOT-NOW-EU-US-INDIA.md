# Why PolicyPilot Now (EU, US, India)

## One-line positioning
PolicyPilot is the adoption intelligence layer for AI governance: it turns policy updates into role-based behavior change with auditable evidence.

## The core business problem
Most companies can write policies, but they struggle to prove that employees actually changed behavior.

Typical gap today:
- Policy document exists.
- Teams run ad hoc training.
- Audit/compliance asks for proof.
- Evidence is fragmented across spreadsheets, LMS exports, and email trails.

PolicyPilot closes this gap end-to-end.

## Why this matters now by region

### Europe (EU)
- The EU AI Act is in phased rollout.
- The Act entered into force on **1 August 2024** and is fully applicable from **2 August 2026** (with staged obligations).
- AI literacy obligations started applying from **2 February 2025**.

What this means for buyers:
- They need operational AI literacy and governance workflows now.
- They need proof that policy obligations are adopted across roles, not just acknowledged.

### United States
- AI governance is a mix of state laws, regulator expectations, and enterprise procurement pressure.
- Example: Colorado’s AI law requirements were moved to be effective by **30 June 2026**.
- NIST AI RMF is widely used as practical governance guidance.

What this means for buyers:
- They need a practical operating layer that works across changing requirements.
- They need fast evidence generation for internal risk teams, customers, and audits.

### India
- The Digital Personal Data Protection Act, 2023 (DPDP) is now a major legal baseline for digital personal data processing.
- CERT-In cyber directions continue to require disciplined incident and security operations.

What this means for buyers:
- They need consistent policy-to-practice execution across distributed teams.
- They need auditable records showing workforce adherence and remediation actions.

## What PolicyPilot gives customers
- Policy-to-learning conversion: upload policy -> role-specific modules.
- Learning-first workflow: material first, assessment second.
- Control mapping: obligations -> controls -> campaigns/modules -> outcomes.
- Evidence system: immutable records, sync status, export readiness.
- Adoption intelligence: freshness, drift risk, intervention recommendations.
- Admin-approved remediation: recommendations are reviewed before execution.

## Why buyers choose this instead of “just LMS” or “just compliance platform”
- LMS tracks completion; PolicyPilot tracks control-level adoption outcomes.
- Compliance platforms aggregate controls; PolicyPilot generates workforce adoption evidence for those controls.
- PolicyPilot is a coexistence layer: it complements GRC stacks instead of replacing them.

## Simple ROI narrative
- Less manual policy rollout work.
- Faster audit evidence preparation.
- Earlier detection of stale controls and behavior drift.
- Better manager visibility into role/team risk.

## 30-second client pitch
“When your AI policy changes, PolicyPilot turns it into role-based learning, tracks who actually adopted the behavior, and produces control-ready evidence. Instead of guessing readiness, your GRC and security teams see fresh vs stale controls, approve remediation actions, and prove adoption to auditors and customers.”

## Discovery questions for sales calls
- How do you currently prove AI policy adoption beyond completion percentages?
- How long does policy update -> audit-ready evidence take today?
- Which controls are hardest to keep fresh across teams and regions?
- Where do remediation actions break down today (owner, timing, follow-through)?
